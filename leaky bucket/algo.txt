BEGIN
    Define total number of packets
    Function randm(a) generates a random packet size
    
    Initialize:
        - Packet sizes array
        - Remaining packet size variable
        - User-defined output rate and bucket size

    Generate random packet sizes (between 10 to 60 bytes)

    Print generated packet sizes

    Get user input:
        - Output rate
        - Bucket size

    FOR each packet:
        IF (packet size + remaining size) exceeds bucket capacity:
            - Reject the packet
        ELSE:
            - Add packet size to remaining size
            - Simulate transmission in time units
            - Send packets based on output rate until empty
            - Display transmission progress
